Question 3: Approximating probability using Simulation
Suppose that as a trial, one tosses a coin 10 times. Write a script that calculates the following using Monte-Carlo approximation method.
• The probability to obtain (exactly) 3 heads. • The probability to obtain (exactly) 6 heads. • The probability to obtain (exactly) 9 heads.
You are supposed to take the number of trials (N) as an input from the user. 2
  
What happens if you try large N values? Comment on the results by considering the actual probability distribution (remember IE265). You should provide your answer as a comment at the end of your script.
